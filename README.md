# Linear-Regression-Using-Salary-Data
This project was built to demonstrate how to build a linear regression models without any external libraries ML libraries, just numpy, pandas, and matplotlib

The data that was used was a two column dataset, YearsExperience & Salary

To minimize the delta between predicted output and actual output, we use mean squared error to measure our error, and adjust our regression coefficients to optimize our model

While Gradient Descent is not the most efficient and optimized way of fitting a regression model, it is important for beginners to understand how it works and how error is measured

Here is the final output
